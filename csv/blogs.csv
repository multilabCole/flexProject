Breweries rely on a variety of hoses to transport liquids and gases throughout their production processes. Each hose is designed to meet specific needs related to the type of liquid or gas being transported, as well as the operating conditions of the brewery. There's some hard work and engineering that has taken place over the centuries to give us this golden nectar of the gods. Not surprising, hoses have played a large part in the development of the brewing process. However, choosing the right hose is not enough. Brewers must also ensure that the hoses are securely connected with the appropriate clamps to prevent leaks and contamination. In this blog post, we will discuss the different types of hoses commonly used in breweries, as well as the types of sanitary clamps used with them. So please, responsibly crack open a cold one and let's learn about all the hoses used in brewing. </p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Food-grade hoses</li></ol><p id="""">Food-grade hoses are designed to handle food and beverage products safely (seems obvious, but let's start there). These hoses are made of materials that meet FDA and other regulatory requirements for food contact. They are often used to transfer liquids such as beer, wine, and other beverages from one tank to another during the brewing process. Food-grade hoses are typically paired with tri-clamp sanitary clamps, which are easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning and maintenance. If you have heard the term FDA approved, think of this type of hose. Although food grade hose is an all encompassing term, it is critically important to make sure brewery hoses are rated for that. </p><ol start=""2"" id=""""><li id="""">PVC hoses</li></ol><p id="""">PVC hoses are lightweight and flexible, making them easy to handle and maneuver around the brewery. There is lots of transferring, connecting, and disconnecting of hoses in a brewery, so weight is key here people. Now pay attention! It should be noted, They are typically used for water and air transfer applications, but their lightweight makes them the best choice for transfer applications. PVC hoses are resistant to chemicals and abrasion, making them a popular choice for cleaning and sanitation purposes. PVC hoses are often connected with single-pin sanitary clamps, which provide a secure and leak-free connection.</p><ol start=""3"" id=""""><li id="""">Silicone hoses</li></ol><p id="""">Silicone hoses are flexible and durable, and they can withstand high temperatures without degrading. These hoses are ideal for applications where hot liquids or gases need to be transferred, such as during the boiling or fermentation stages of the brewing process. This is the same type of hose that is used in other applications where coolant is transferred for automotive purposes. Sanitation is key here as well. Silicone hoses are a great candidate for this process because they remain flexible even with media in them, at very hot temperatures. </p><ol start=""4"" id=""""><li id="""">Stainless steel hoses and Tubes</li></ol><p id="""">Stainless steel hoses are highly durable and resistant to corrosion, making them a popular choice for use in breweries. They can handle high-pressure applications, especially the tubing, or what is often called ""hardlines"" and are often used for transferring liquids or gases under pressure, such as for carbonation or keg filling. If you just had flashbacks to your younger days, and perhaps in that flashback you were upside down, then we can be friends. Stainless steel hoses are typically connected with tri-clamp sanitary clamps, which are easy to clean and maintain.</p><ol start=""5"" id=""""><li id="""">PTFE hoses (Teflon)</li></ol><p id="""">Polytetrafluoroethylene hose, or Teflon hose, as you most likely know them as, are highly chemical-resistant and can withstand extreme temperatures. They are often used to transfer harsh chemicals and acids within a brewery, such as for cleaning or sterilization purposes. Teflon hoses are commonly paired with wing-nut sanitary clamps, which are easy to tighten and provide a secure connection. These teflon hoses usually have a stainless steel braid around them, but not always. It should also be noted that Teflon is a registered name of Dupont. The more you know! </p><p id="""">Choosing the right hose is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of a brewery. However, it is equally important to ensure that the hoses are securely connected with the appropriate sanitary clamps. By understanding the different types of hoses and sanitary clamps available, breweries can choose the right combination for their application, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of their production processes. It's a lot of science, a little bit of magic, and a whole lot of love and hangovers that have refined the brewing process. Hoses play a critical role, and American Hose and Supply sells a complete line of products to help make that double IPA you've been dreaming of a hit. <a href=""/contact"">Contact</a> us right now to get started.

This means that they are a way to connect or disconnect a hose or pipe in a speedy, efficient way without having to involve complex tools or equipment. These connections guarantee tight and secure bonds because of the way that the ""cams"" lock their counterpart into place (Cam-Lock, get it?)<br>‍<br>The female side, as it's commonly referred to, has two handles or ""ears"" (the cams!) that are used to seat and seal the mating camlock (or male side) to the gasket of the female side, thus creating a leakproof seal that is easily disconnected and applied over and over again. Keep the giggling to yourself but basically, the male part is put into the female part, just like you learned in 7th grade biology, or 10th grade for some of you in the back.<br><br>Camlock couplings are great for the transfer of both dry and fluid materials. There are a variety<br>of camlock uses, such as transferring food, water, fuel, or sand and making them suitable for<br>almost any industry. Because of the variety of substances that can flow through the camlock, it is important to choose the right material for the job. Common camlock applications and their<br>materials are:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Stainless Steel Camlocks</strong> are best suited for acid, alkali, and corrosive substances.<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Polypropylene and Nylon Camlocks</strong> can be used in the chemical industry, for transmitting liquid, and for irrigation in the agricultural industry.<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Brass Camlocks</strong> work very well for transmitting salty water. They are suitable for most environments except for acid and alkali.<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Aluminum Alloy Camlocks </strong>are great for use with fresh water or mixtures of oil and<br>water.<br></li></ul><p id="""">Here's a quick lesson in camlock call outs, as well as a refresher of the alphabet. Almost universally, Camlocks are classified with an A through F part number, as well as dust cap and dust plug. Yes, there are jump size camlocks and conversion camlocks, but for the sake of today's conversation let's stick with the basics. Those basics are:<br></p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">A</strong> - &nbsp;male camlock x female thread (by the way, the thread is <strong id="""">almost</strong> always, always NPT)<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">B </strong>- female camlock x &nbsp;male thread<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">C</strong> - female camlock x hose shank (a shank is basically a hose barb that you put in the hose)<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">D</strong> - female camlock X female thread<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">E</strong> - male camlock x hose shank<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">F</strong> - male camlock x female thread<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">DC</strong> - dust cap - this ""caps off"" a male camlock. Think of it as a hat.<br></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">DP</strong> - dust plug - this plugs up a female camlock.<br></li></ul><p id="""">To review, this type of callout on camlocks is relatively universal but remember, there are always exceptions. So if you are confused, or perhaps just a little bit unsure (it's okay, we don't judge), then call up one of the hose and fittings experts at American Hose and Supply.

Buuuuut, just what precisely is it? Well, this term is essentially referring to the movement, storage, control, and protection of goods and materials throughout the supply chain, from the point of origin to the point of consumption. There's usually a long road a product takes to get into your grubby paws (they're beautiful), and there's a whole industry focused on making sure it gets there in one piece. By now, it should be no surprise to you that our favorite H word plays a big role in this industry. The H word is hydraulics, to be clear.</p><p id="""">Hydraulic components play a key role in material handling equipment, powering the hydraulic systems that control the movement of heavy loads and materials. From forklifts and cranes, to conveyor systems and automated guided vehicles, hydraulic components are essential for efficient and effective material handling. It is not impossible to move parts and products without hydraulics, but we sure don't want to think about it, not today Satan. </p><p id="""">In this blog post, we'll take a look at five different types of hydraulic components used in the material handling industry. While these components may not have personalities of their own (except for those control valves, those rascals), they each have unique functions and capabilities that make them indispensable to the world of material handling. So let's dive in and learn more!</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Hydraulic Pumps: These hydraulic components convert mechanical power into hydraulic energy, which is used to power the hydraulic system in material handling equipment. Gear pumps, vane pumps, and piston pumps, are all types of hydraulic pumps to name a few, each with their own unique features and benefits.</li><li id="""">Hydraulic Cylinders: These components use hydraulic pressure to create linear motion, which is used to lift and move heavy loads in material handling equipment. Without this bit of technology, it would be pulleys and chains that would lift heavy loads. Hydraulic cylinders are often used in forklifts, cranes, and other lifting equipment, and are critical for efficient and safe material handling.</li><li id="""">Directional Control Valves: These hydraulic components control the flow of hydraulic fluid in a hydraulic system, directing it to the appropriate hydraulic cylinder or motor. They are essential for ensuring that the hydraulic system operates efficiently and effectively. Think of this component as the traffic director of the operation. making sure that things are flowing as they should, in the direction they should.</li><li id="""">Hydraulic Hoses: These flexible tubes carry hydraulic fluid between hydraulic components in a hydraulic system. They are critical for maintaining the flow of hydraulic fluid, and must be durable and able to withstand high pressure and extreme temperatures. Email us <a href=""/contact"" id="""">here</a> if you are unsure about what hose you need for your hydraulic system!</li><li id="""">The Pressure Relief Valve: This hydraulic component is like the overprotective parent of the group, always worrying about safety and making sure everyone's okay. Its job is to prevent the hydraulic system from becoming over-pressurized, which is an important responsibility. But it can also be a bit of a buzzkill, always reminding everyone to be careful and not take unnecessary risks.

No matter the industry, such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing, they are used to generate and transmit mechanical power. Specifically, valves control the flow of media (that’s fancy talk for “whatever is moving through the hose / system”).&nbsp;</p><p id="""">There are several different types of valves used in hydraulic systems, each with its own unique function and application. These valves can be broadly categorized into the following types:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Check valves - These valves are used to prevent the backflow of fluid in a hydraulic system. They typically have a spring-loaded disc or flapper that opens when fluid flows in the desired direction and closes when the flow reverses. This ensures that the fluid only flows in one direction and prevents damage to the system. Think of it as a one -way door. You can go in that way, but not back out that way. Make sense? Aside from being spring operated, check valves also came as a swing check, which as stated before is like a flapper or swinging gate.&nbsp;</li><li id="""">Pressure relief valves - These valves are used to regulate the pressure in a hydraulic system. They typically have a spring-loaded plunger or piston that opens when the fluid pressure exceeds a predetermined limit, allowing excess fluid to bypass the main flow and return to the reservoir. This prevents the system from over-pressurizing and damaging components. In the industry, you may hear this called a PRV. Another term you may have heard of is a pop-off valve. A pop-off valve is a pressure relief valve that does not reroute the fluid or air to a reservoir, it simply allows excess pressure to escape the system into the air if the system becomes over pressured&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li id="""">Flow control valves - These valves are used to regulate the flow rate of fluid in a hydraulic system. They are typically installed in a pipeline and have a moveable orifice or spool that can be adjusted to restrict or increase the flow of fluid. This allows the operator to control the flow rate and adjust the system's performance to suit the task at hand. A gate valve would be a type of flow control valve. Think of your living room window. The more you open it, the more air can move through it. So flow control valves act as a gate, which can be opened a lot or a little, regulating the flow&nbsp;</li><li id="""">Directional control valves - These valves are used to direct the flow of fluid in a hydraulic system. They typically have a series of ports, spools, and pistons that can be moved to redirect the flow of fluid or vapor. This allows the operator to control the direction of fluid flow and activate or deactivate hydraulic and air components as needed. An easy way to think of a directional control valve is to think of a 4-way traffic stop. The flow (of vehicles) changes as certain lanes are instructed to stop or go. If you hear the term 3 way or diverter valve, those would be directional control valves as well.</li><li id="""">Pilot-operated valves - These valves are used to control the flow of fluid in an air or hydraulic system using a separate, smaller flow of fluid. They are typically installed in a way so a secondary inlet port allows a small amount of fluid to act on a piston or spool, which in turn controls the main flow of fluid. So think of this as using the force of the material that is already present in the system, having a small amount of that force that also flows through another small system, and that system can be used to open or close a valve on the big system. Confused yet? This allows the operator to control the flow of fluid using a smaller, more precise input. A pilot valve can be used in a situation where there is a very large pipeline with a very large valve that would be difficult to manually operate.&nbsp;</li></ol><p id="""">The different types of valves used in hydraulic and air systems vary, depending on the application. It is true, however, that there is no set rule for when to use each valve.&nbsp; Each type has its own unique function and application and is essential for the effective operation of a hydraulic or air system.</p><p id="""">If all this blog did was confuse you on what valve you need, then two things need to be said: 1. - sorry. 2. - <a href="""" id="""">Call</a> the experts at American Hose and Supply, they are ready to help<br></p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa80b773843e4_Group%20359%20(2).jpg,Sun Feb 12 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa80b773843e4_Group%20359%20(2).jpg

Well you do now! There are several different types of industrial hoses, each with their own specific use and application. Typically, Industrial hoses will be rated for much lower pressure than hydraulic hose, but will carry a much wider array of media through them. Some of the most common types of industrial hoses include:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Air hoses:</strong> These hoses are typically used to transport air or other gasses, and are commonly found in pneumatic systems or in air compressors. Air hoses are typically made of rubber with a rubber outer cover, but sometimes they come in a PVC material, or a blend of materials. Air hoses are used in tire shops, your garage, and all types of industrial facilities that use air for tools or material handling.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Water hoses: </strong>Water hoses are used to transport water or other liquids, and are often found in gardening or landscaping applications, as well as in industrial settings such as factories or warehouses. Water hoses are typically made of rubber or other flexible materials, and can come in different sizes. Typically, water hoses such as a garden hose, are ⅝ in size, but depending on the application that size will vary.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Chemical hoses: </strong>Chemical hoses are designed to transport chemicals or other hazardous materials, and are typically made of materials that are resistant to the specific chemicals being transported. Chemical hoses are often used in industrial settings, and are often made of rubber or other flexible materials. Two very common types of Chemical hoses are commonly called UHMW, or XLPE. UHMW stands for Ultra Heavy Molecular Weight, while XLPE stands for Cross-Link Polyethylene. Both can handle a wide range of acids and chemical mixtures, but it’s critical to make sure whatever media you are moving, you make certain the hose you will be using can tolerate it.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Steam hoses: </strong>Steam hoses are designed to transport steam, and are often found in industrial settings such as factories or power plants. Steam hoses are typically made of NBR rubber, but specifically, there are compounds in the construction that are built to withstand temperatures that exceed 300 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Welding hoses:</strong> Welding hoses are used to transport welding gasses, and are often found in welding or metalworking applications. Welding hoses will oftentimes come in a twin line setup. This is two hoses bonded together. Usually one will be oxygen and the other will be acetylene. This is very common, though not always the case.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Fuel hoses:</strong> Fuel hoses are used to transport fuel or other flammable liquids, and are often found in automotive or aviation applications. Fuel hoses are typically made of EPDM or Nitrile, and can come in different sizes and lengths to suit different needs. Filler necks on large machinery would be a common application for fuel line. (A filler neck is the tube that goes from the fuel door to the gas tank, FYI)&nbsp;</li></ul><p id="""">Overall, the different types of industrial hoses serve a variety of important functions, and are essential for many industrial and commercial applications.Think of it this way: Is that hydraulic fluid moving through the hose?

The list goes on and on. Truth is, and regardless of your position on the matter, those dinosaur bones deep in our mother earth are the source from which we get lots of our energy. The exploration and extraction of those products is a massive industry. That industry leans on companies like American Hose and Supply to keep all types of petroleum products moving from deep in the sedimental primordial ooze, all the way to the fueling station. Now before we get too deep into this talk, it's important to note that what is being covered here includes hose and componentry that handles both refined, and unrefined petroleum products. </p><p id="""">Here is a list of some of the hose and fittings products used in the Oil and Gas industry:</p><p id="""">‍<br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Oilfield Suction Hose</strong> - This hose can handle unrefined petroleum products, water, slurry, and some oils. It is used often to move crude media. Typically, this hose can handle 150 PSI, and a full vacuum. There's a set of helical wires that move through the hose, which prevents its collapse. In many cases, this hose comes corrugated, which increases its flexibility, i.e. bend radius. Oilfield suction hose almost always will have a blue stripe on the outer cover of the hose, which aids in visual identification. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Tank Truck Hose</strong> - Often called tanker hose, or red stripe hose, this is also a 150 PSI rated, typically corrugated hose. Tank truck hose can handle both unrefined and refined petroleum products. It is important to note that both this hose and oilfield suction do come in a version suitable for 300 PSI, though it is not always commonplace, but you better believe that American Hose and Supply has it in stock and ready to ship! Tank truck hose will almost always have a red stripe or red lettering on the outside cover. This hose is rugged and abrasion resistant, which adds to its appeal but also makes for a heavy haul if the hose lengths are long. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Gasoline Drop Hose</strong> - So to recap, Oilfield hose can handle unrefined petroleum products, tank truck hose and handle both unrefined and refined petroleum products, and this subject - Gasoline Drop Hose - can handle only refined petroleum products. For example - Ethanol, Diesel, and gasoline are acceptable products to use with this hose. This hose is usually black with an orange outer helix. Within the lining of this hose is a copper grounding wire, used to dissipate static electricity. You do not want a little spark mingling with the type of media that this hose carries. If it did you would have a very loud, hot, and unfortunate situation on your hands, or what used to be your hands..... This hose is used a lot on tankers that fill up &nbsp;the underground tanks for gasoline at fuel stations. &nbsp;</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Valves</strong> - &nbsp;Gate valves, ball valves, swing check valves, actuated valves, and a whole host of other types of valve products are absolutely critical when it comes to storing and directing the flow of liquid and gaseous fuels. These valves are usually accompanied by long spances of piping with all types of vats and routing stations in between. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">High Pressure Hose</strong> - There is a whole host of hoses utilized in oil and gas extraction. Many of these hoses have to be able to withstand thousands of PSI. For example, you may have heard the term slim rotary hose - which is a type of hose used for mobile drilling applications. Typically, these hoses are larger in diameter (2.5 - 4 inches) and have a max operating requirement of approximately 3000 PSI. This hose, as well as other industry specific hose products such as kelly hose, jetter hose, or final drive hoses, all have a multi-spiral wire construction, and are designed for pulsating swings in pressure, over long periods of time. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">If the only thing you know about oil and gas is that you think you look good in a hard hat, and love the movie there will be blood, then <a href=""tel:9182340585"">call</a> the experts at American Hose and Supply. We can help you sort out what hose and valves you need to turn that oil and gas into some gold. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa87883384378_Oil%20Meme%20(2)%20(1).jpg,Mon Jan 02 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa87883384378_Oil%20Meme%20(2)%20(1).jpg

Is anyone hurt or burned? Is equipment on<br>fire? If none of these things are happening, the worst thing you might have to do is fill out an incident<br>report if you’re on a job, and if you’re just working by yourself in the field, you may have a bit of a<br>hydraulic mess to clean up.<br>‍<br>Blowing a hydraulic hose assembly happens. There is an overabundance of engineering that goes into<br>the manufacturing of hydraulic hose assemblies, but even so, nothing lasts forever. This post is designed<br>to help you understand how to get some questions answered so a replacement hose can be made (from<br>your friends at American Hose and Supply) and get you operational again as quick as possible. There is a<br>simple acronym you can use to help determine what hose you will need: STAMPED.<br>‍<br>S- Size<br>T-Temperature<br>A-Application<br>M-Media / Materials<br>P-Pressure<br>E-Ends<br>D-Delivery<br><br>A quick search of this acronym online will give you several in depth articles outlining these seven areas<br>of hydraulic requirements. Should you have time to deep dive, have at it! But out of respect for your<br>time and brain, here is a quick run through of what each letter means (what you need to figure out/ ask<br>about!). Before we do that, it should be noted that you can bypass figuring out most of these answers by<br>bringing in your hydraulic hose to American Hose and Supply. Once there, someone will still probably<br>ask you what’s moving through it, and they most certainly will ask you if you would like a drink or some<br>chips while you wait. I digress….</p><h1>Size</h1><p>Easy. What size is it? The only thing to remember is that hydraulic hoses and industrial hoses alike are<br>almost always measured by the internal diameter. I say almost because I don’t want someone to @me<br>with the one exception they know about. (But seriously, you can always throw shade or ask questions to<br>us, just check out contact us tab) The size of the hose might even be stamped or printed on the hose<br>itself.</p><h1>Temperature</h1><p>This includes two answers usually- What’s the temperature of the media moving through the hose, and<br>is it super-hot or cold around the hose? In other words, what’s the environment the hose is in? As<br>temperature around and in the hose increases, the amount of pressure the hose can take decreases. If<br>you can see information stamped or printed on the hose, this required detail is usually included there.</p><h1>Application</h1><p>What’s it being used for? Is it on the side of a dozer cylinder? Does it go inside of a boom crane? Is it off<br>that hydraulic reclining couch you’ve been developing? (Don’t listen to the haters, it’s gonna be a hit!)<br>This answer probably should include if any tight bends or routing constraints are going to be of concern.</p><h1>Media/Material</h1><p>This one is also easy. What’s moving through it? Usually the answer is hydraulic fluid or water. Not<br>always, however. American Hose and Supply offers industrial hoses that can carry all sorts of things.<br>Steam hoses, cement hose, dry bulk material hose, and propane hose, heck even hoses that transport<br>minerals and acids are common stock items. If you know what is going to be in the hose, then you can<br>answer this one. Look at ya go….. smarty pants.</p><h1>Ends</h1><p>Okay, this is one that might take a bit more of a deep dive, but let’s just state what is obvious for this<br>category; What ends are going on the hose? Once again, the easiest way to answer this question is to<br>bring in your hose assembly to American Hose and Supply. Another option to get this answered is to call<br>us at 918-234-0585, and request to send us an email or text of a picture of each end. There are some<br>instances where we would still need some dimensional data about the fittings, but most times our<br>customer service technicians can figure it out with just that! Check our resources tab for a healthy<br>breakdown of what some hydraulic ends look like with supporting dimensional data, but some usual<br>suspects include; JIC, Pipe Thread, SAE (commonly called O-ring Boss), Face Seal, and Pipe Swivel. Here<br>are some questions get you dialed in. Do the ends swivel? Is it a female thread or a male thread? Is there<br>an O-ring? If you can determine these three answers on your own, you’ve eliminated a lot of options<br>and are closer to victory (cue the Guess Who board game commercial theme song from my childhood).</p><h4>Delivery</h4><p>When do you want it and are there any other requirements? Usually the answer is something like, “I<br>want it right now, just give it to me not broken.” That’s an acceptable answer. Other things to consider<br>would be if you need any certification, packaging, or tagging of the hose assembly. American Hose and<br>Supply offers hydrostatic testing and certification. Should you need that or some traceable tagging, we<br>have you covered.<br>To review, when you have a blown or broken hydraulic hose or industrial hose assembly, the best and<br>usually quickest solution is to take it to the hose experts at American Hose and Supply. If that simply<br>isn’t in the cards, look on the hose and see what information is stamped or printed on there. Lastly, call<br>us at 918-234-0585 and ask to send us some pictures of what you need replaced.<br>There are many things to take into account when you have a blown hose problem on your hands. A<br>good way to avoid getting stuck or shut down and needing a hose in a hurry is to exercise a little<br>preventative maintenance. If you notice cracking in the cover of your hose or hoses, and especially if you<br>have hydraulic hoses down to the wire braid or there is fluid seeping from anywhere on the hose<br>assembly, you are better off taking the hose off and replacing it before it finally blows out on you. Asaying someone much wiser than me once said, maybe Abraham Lincoln, or maybe I saw it in a<br>commercial, but anyway. The saying is, “preventative maintenance trumps emergency intervention<br>every time.” Nowhere is this truer for both your safety and wallet than with hydraulics. Figuring out<br>what you need to replace a hose successfully can be done by remembering the STAMPED method. Our<br>technicians are trained in this same way. So answer what letters you can, and leave the rest to the<br>experts in hydraulics and industrial hose assembly at American Hose and Supply.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa8978f3831c8_606e4bee78c5513f7ea65799_Untitled%20design%20(4).jpeg,Wed Apr 07 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa8648638336f_62810d81690a1585954fd747_26%20(1).png

While most of the time you may think of the pipes under your house, or perhaps images of a rapidly backing up toilet at a party come to mind. No? Just us? Well allow us to broaden your understanding of what all is utilized in plumbing and how you can get all these fabulous items from American Hose and Supply. Here's a list of commonly used items in the plumbing industry.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Compression Thread</strong> - Compression thread is finer than NPT thread. Typically compression thread is not simple a threaded coupling or adapter, as in it will not seat or seal off on its own. A compression thread is usually 3 parts, It's a trifecta of sealing perfection. The three parts are the threads, in which the tubing or pipe seats inside of, a ferrule, and a compression nut. you will see this commonly used with copper pipe, and in several types of tubing. The nut is first slid back onto the tube, followed by the ferrule. The tube is then seated into the fitting, which will have threads on the outside. the ferrule is essentially smashed when the nut is &nbsp;fastened onto the mating threads, causing the compression ferrule to seal the tube and the fitting together. Look under your sink, more than likely you will see this fluid conveyance marvel at work. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">PTFE Tape and Pipe Dope</strong> - Whichever team you are on, the age old battle of which helps with sealing better will never be settled. PTFE Tape, which stands for Polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly referred to as Teflon (a trademark of Dupont), is a synthetic material used to aid in the sealing of NPT threads. Pipe dope, is essentially the same, but in a paste from. The tape and dope is applied where male and female threads are mated together. The tape can come in different densities, which are better suited for different materials. a PVC or polyethylene thread is a great candidate for thicker tape ( usually yellow or blue in color ), while carbon steel and stainless steel threads will be perfectly fine with a standard or thinner tape applied. If you were to look into the tool bag of a plumber, you most certainly would see one of these handy items. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Braided Stainless Steel Hose </strong>- SAE 100R15, as well as 100R14, is commonly referred to as braided stainless hose, or some people may know it as just flex hose. We don't know the technical term, but the sprayer part on a kitchen sink is usually tethered to the water source by a hose of this making. The outer braid of this hose is excellent at preventing rust from forming, and the liner on the inside, which is usually a nitrile rubber or PTFE material, is excellent at handling both hot and cold media moving through it. Because of its flexibility and durability, you will usually find these hoses under your sink, hanging out with those compression threads . Another place this type of hose is used at sometimes is for washing machine hook ups. While a general service hose may work for this application, the superior temperature tolerance and bend radius of the braided stainless steel proves to be the preferred choice. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">American Hose and Supply offers all of these items. We can even build your sink hoses to fit your design needs. So go ahead, buy that massive Nascar themed faucet, you know you've been wanting it. We will help you extend those hoses and sell you some sealing products so it won't leak, but we can't help you defend your design choice. You have been warned.

With so many different brands, models, and features to choose from, it can be difficult to know which one will be the best fit for your needs. In this article, we will provide some tips and guidance on how to make an informed decision and choose the right pressure washer. But seriously, the red ranger is cool but he's no black ranger (mastodon!)</p><p id="""">First and foremost, it’s important to understand what a pressure washer is and how it works. A pressure washer is a powerful cleaning tool that uses high-pressure water to remove dirt, grime, and other debris from surfaces. It uses a motor and pump to generate high water pressure, which is then directed through a nozzle onto the surface being cleaned. This high-pressure water spray is able to remove stubborn stains and dirt that other cleaning methods cannot, making it an effective and efficient tool for a variety of cleaning tasks. So pressure is used to wash the surface, get it??</p><p id="""">Before deciding on a pressure washer, it’s important to consider your specific cleaning needs and requirements. This will help you determine the type and size of pressure washer that will be best for your company. Some factors to consider include:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>The type of surfaces you will be cleaning:</strong> Different pressure washers are designed for different types of surfaces, such as concrete, wood, or metal. Choose a pressure washer with a nozzle and pressure settings that are suitable for the surfaces you will be cleaning. Furthermore, consider if a cold water unit or a hot water unit is best suited for you. Hot water units involve a burner to heat the water, and are usually more expensive, but are typically considered more effective than cold water units. </li><li id=""""><strong>The size of the surfaces you will be cleaning:</strong> The size of the surfaces you will be cleaning will determine the size and power of the pressure washer you need. For example, a small pressure washer may be suitable for cleaning a car, but not for cleaning a large building or concrete surface.</li><li id=""""><strong>The amount of cleaning you will be doing:</strong> Consider how often you will be using the pressure washer and how much cleaning you will be doing. If you will be using the pressure washer regularly, it’s important to choose a model that is durable and reliable. This is where you truly DO get what you pay for. We understand saving a buck or two. If you are using this on your vinyl siding of your club house then that's perfect. If you have an expectation for your pressure washer unit to be used every day, making you revenue, then consider spending a few more green backs. Which leads us to this next point. </li><li id=""""><strong>Your budget:</strong> Pressure washers can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Determine your budget and choose a pressure washer that fits within it, but also consider the long-term cost of ownership and maintenance. Pressure washers are rugged machinery, but their users (that's you) are usually ruggeder (not a word, but you get it). </li></ul><p id="""">Once you have a clear idea of your cleaning needs and requirements, you can begin looking at different pressure washer models and features. Here are some key features to consider:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong>Water pressure: </strong>The water pressure of a pressure washer is measured in pounds per square inch (PSI) and gallons per minute (GPM). Higher pressure and flow rates will be more effective at cleaning tough stains and debris, but can also be more expensive and require more maintenance. Choose a pressure washer with the right balance of pressure and flow rate for your needs. Residential or ""hobby"" washers usually run 1700 to 2300 PSI, where commercial units start on the very low end of 3000 and can exceed 6000 PSI. </li><li id=""""><strong>Motor and pump:</strong> The motor and pump are the heart of the pressure washer, providing the power and pressure needed for cleaning. Choose a pressure washer with a high-quality motor and pump, as these are essential for reliable and efficient operation.</li><li id=""""><strong>Nozzles and attachments:</strong> Pressure washers come with a variety of nozzles and attachments for different cleaning tasks and surfaces. Choose a pressure washer with a range of nozzles and attachments that will allow you to tackle different cleaning tasks and surfaces. Colored tips with varying spray angles are very common for mid sized units and you can purchase them <a href=""/"" id="""">here</a>. </li><li id=""""><strong>Portability:</strong> If you will be using the pressure washer at multiple locations or need to move it around your property, consider a pressure washer that is lightweight and easy to transport. Trailer mounted pressure wash units are becoming more and more popular. One thing to keep in mind with open trailer units is the weather, particularly freezing temperatures. All that fancy hose routing and beautiful water tanks will split in a New York minute if left out in the freezing cold. If so, you will be calling us in no time to get you back up and running. We will feel bad for you, even cry with you, but will be happy to help you get going again! </li><li id="""">A pressure washer is a significant investment, so it’s important to choose a model that is built to last and will provide reliable operation.<br></li></ul><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Are you excited to hop into the pressure wash industry, but unsure if you're making the right purchasing decisions?

Truly, they are an impressive engineering feat. They handle all sorts of harsh external conditions, crazy temperature swings, and they can hold thousands of pounds of pressure. Hoses can carry all sorts of media and materials through twist and turns for long distances and it all works without a hitch....usually. Sometimes a hose fails. All good things must come to an end. This post is to go over reasons why a hose might prematurely fail. Humans usually play a role in building hose assemblies, and if us homo sapiens are involved, we are probably gonna mess something up. For instance:</p><h1>Under or Over Crimped:</h1><p>Hydraulic hoses usually consist of a mechanically crimped end. These ends can be but are not limited to a bite-to-wire style, a compression style, a two or three piece configuration, and even a hand applied field attachable version. These ends require a final crimp OD (outside diameter), of exacting requirements, usually specified to 3 decimal places. Depending on the manufacturer's specifications, there's usually an accepted tolerance (i.e. you're allowed to be wrong / mess it up) by something like +/- .003, .005, or sometimes .010. This section could open up a pandora's hydraulic box &nbsp;when it comes to schools of thought on if it's acceptable to &nbsp;use one brand of fitting on another brand of hose, but that's not a battle we are going to fight today.</p><h1>Over Bent or Incorrectly Routed:</h1><p>The way a hydraulic hose is constructed lends itself to be able to twist and turn quite well, but there are limits. Some people like to play twister with hoses, and that's where we run into trouble (Left hand red!). A hydraulic hose has a specified and accepted bend radius. This spec can typically be found from the manufacturer, usually in a table that will also include its operating pressure and crimp spec. A bend radius is defined by how many inches of distance a hose needs to be able to make a 180 degree turn. That's a semi circle, half a pizza, or a rainbow shape for all the whiz kids in the back of the class. Pay Attention! Yes you!<br><br>Going past this spec will cause the hose to kink, usually compromising the structural integrity which will cause the hose to fail. If you are experiencing a routing or bending problem on your project don't fret, the professionals at American Hose and Supply can help you. We've seen a few things, and we can help sort out your tight space spaghetti bowl hose fiasco.</p><h1>Too Much Pressure</h1><p>Remember that spelling bee you were in? Remember when you cracked under the pressure and accidentally misspelled the word milk? No? Well that didn't happen to me or anything but just like failing when the pressure gets to be too much, the same thing happens to hydraulic hoses. There are two numbers to pay attention to with hoses, but only one you need to rely on.<br><br>First is the maximum operating pressure. This pressure rating is usually printed on the hose itself in either bar or psi. Side note here; 1 bar is equal to 14.5 psi. If you are only provided the bar rating, whip out that smart phone and let it do some multiplying for you. The max operating pressure simply put is what the hose is engineered to perform at constantly, or darn near constantly. This means under a continuous stress load, not exceeding the operating pressure, the hose will not fail. Let this be your guiding light when choosing what hose to use. Always stay under your operating pressure.<br><br>The second metric is the minimum burst pressure. This pressure refers to the pressure the hose will tolerate in a spike scenario before a catastrophic failure. This pressure is usually 4 times the rate of the operating pressure. This is often referred to as the safety rating. A safety rating will be denoted as such - 4:1 or 3:1 and so on. a 4 to 1 rating of a 5000 PSI hose means it can tolerate a spike of up to 20,000 psi before a failure.<br><br>Do not, I repeat - Do not rely on the burst pressure to cover your you know what in a hydraulic application. Just because the hose has a burst pressure of 20,000 doesn't mean you can run your pumpkin chunker device at 7,000 psi. A premature hose failure will occur if the operating pressure is exceeded for too long.</p><h1>Mother Nature</h1><p>She's beautiful but darn it she's a cruel mistress. Mother nature can really do a number on hoses. Too much UV, ozone, heat or cold can affect the outer cover of your hydraulic hose. Inspect your hoses from time to time. If you see cracking, if they appear brittle, or perhaps if they are even soft and mushy to the touch, you need to take them into American Hose and Supply. Aside from getting you a new hose, there are products we offer that can increase the life of your hose and protect if from the elements. These products would be spiral wrap, nylon hose sleeving, silicone jacketing, or even a technician to hold an umbrella over the machine while you work (not really).</p><h1>Cuts &amp; Rubs</h1><p>Vibration is the enemy of a hose. If it's slapping against the side boom or rubbing a floor pan, that outer cover is gonna wear down quick, fast and in a hurry. If the hose is routed as such where it might get a small cut or scrape, the longevity of your hose will be cut short. A good rule of thumb is that if you can see wires on your hose, you are about to experience a hose blow out. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen sooner than later.<br><br>Okay okay, enough with all these doomsday hose problems. Your hoses are fine! Probably, maybe. It's important to check your hoses often the same way as you check your oil or your tires. Remember that preventative maintenance will trump emergency intervention every time, and it will usually save you some money in the long run. The team at American Hose can help you assess your hose situation, and give recommendations on if it's time to replace, reroute, or better protect anything. Not sure? Call or text the hose hotline 24/7 at 918-234-0585. Rain or shine we'd love to help.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa8573f383187_612fd5fd5d56d85876c242e9_Untitled%20design%20(4).jpeg,Wed Sep 01 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa87588383370_62810d81690a154f204fd75d_173%20(1)%20(1).jpeg

That stands for Department Of Transportation, and let me tell ya, if you have ever ran into them, you probably do not want to run into them again. DOT's job is a necessary one - to make sure large freight haulers and utility vehicles adhere to certain standards and utilize components on their trucks that meet a certain criterion of performance and safety. To put it in simple terms, you gotta follow the rules of the road or you're gonna be met with a fine, and you're going to hope that's all that happens to you (gasp!). </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Okay perhaps that's a bit dramatic, but the takeaway here is that keeping your fleet vehicles up and running can be a timely task, so making sure you put parts on that meet the needed specifications is something you want to be sure of. American Hose and Supply has DOT air and hydraulic components to keep your machines running like well oiled......machines. Below are the 5 most replaced parts on fleet service vehicles that require a DOT approval. </p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id="""">1 - Air Brake Tubing<br></h2><p id="""">This tubing is typically made from nylon and per D.O.T, it is required to be nylon to meet the SAE requirement (SAE J844, if you want to challenge us on this one). There are two types of this tubing, DOT A and DOT B. DOT A is any nylon tubing 5/16 or smaller, and is used primarily on instrumentation that is connected to the air brake system. </p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">DOT B is anything larger than 5/16 that has a nylon braid embedded in the wall of the tubing. Air brake tubing comes in all types of colors for traceability, and American Hose and Supply offers both DOT A and B tubing. We can sell you a whole spool or just a few inches if you forgot your drinking straw. </p><p id=""""><br></p><h2 id="""">2- Air Brake Fittings<br></h2><p>Oh gosh. This is the part of the topic where the house gets divided. Air brake fittings come in two styles and also two materials. One material is brass, and the other is ""composite"" material, which is essentially polypropylene. the two styles are a compression style, where there is a ferrule that is basically crushed onto the tubing then secured into place with a threaded tube nut, and the other style is referred to by a few names, most notably being ""push to connect."" Other names for this style are push-lock, push / pull, and shark bite (it's not a shark bite fitting at all, but we can kinda see why you'd call it that). </p><p>‍</p><p>Some people swear by only using composite push to connect, while other's won't put anything on their fleet but brass compression, or some combination of that. All that matters is that little brass ring or nut is stamped with those 3 little letters, DOT. American Hose and Supply offers all combinations of push to connect and compression style DOT air brake fittings. If you do not see what you need on the site, please, call us! </p><p>‍<br></p><h2 id="""">3- Fuel Delivery Hose<br></h2><p id="""">This can be a few products but most of the time it is referred to as ""stratoflex"" or you may know it as cloth braid hose.You guessed it, It's DOT rated and requires ends that are stamped DOT as well. You guessed it again, we have this product available! Over time this hose can become brittle due to big swings in temperature change over years of use. </p><p>‍<br></p><h2 id="""">4- Brass SAE Fittings<br></h2><p id="""">SAE brass fittings are the most common in air applications. With limited exception, all brass SAE fittings are DOT approved, but we cannot say the same for steel fittings, so make sure the material you are using is not only correct for the job, but will pass any inspections you may face. SAE brass fittings have a cone seat that is 45 degrees, whereas JIC fittings are 37 degrees, and normally steel. Salt exposure and over tightening are both the mortal enemies of this type of fitting. </p><p>‍<br></p><h2 id="""">5- Silicone / Radiator Hose<br></h2><p id="""">Hump hose, CAC hose, stick hose, heater hose, and coolant hose are all names you might hear this one called. These come in just straight and molded versions, so it's important to check with an American Hose and Supply customer service specialist to learn which one you might need. Typically this hose will split over time due to incredibly long periods of high heat exposure coupled with vibration. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">If you need help keeping your fleet running, we are happy to lend a helping hose hand (or something like that.... that sounds odd, but you get it). Call or stop by, you'll be glad you did. </p><p id="""">‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa81e6d384279_Group%20249%20(2).jpeg,Mon Nov 21 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa87957384276_Group%20248%201%20(1)%20(1).png

We are going to try and untangle some terms that get thrown around a lot in the hydraulic industry with reckless abandon (and sometimes used incorrectly). Inconceivable! Nay, it is not.<br><br>Over the years many segments of industry have coined their own terms or colloquial verbiage when it comes to hydraulic fittings and configurations. This post is designed to teach you what the fitting actually is, what engineers call it, what shade tree mechanics call it, what people who are just wrong call it, and what your conspiracy theory having uncle calls it (beware the lizard people!). With all that in mind, strap yourself in, this might get bumpy.<br><br>Let’s examine some of the most common ends and what their abbreviations stand for, and what dimensional attributes they have.</p><h1 id="""">JIC</h1><p id="""">JIC actually stands for Joint Industry Council, and is the jealous cousin of SAE fittings. JIC was derived originally from another term you may hear, AN thread. It’s thread pitch is the same as an SAE 45 degree fittings, but it’s cone seat is 37.5 degree. How on earth do you get half a degree? No one knows, but it’s important. </p><p id="""">This type of hydraulic fitting is typically used in high pressure applications, as well as when test ports are needed. JIC threads make up a large percentage of what you will see on industrial machinery. To place an exact number on the market use of this style of fittings is impossible, but it sure is a lot.<br>‍<br>You will hear JIC called – AN, FLARE, CONE SEAT, POINTY LOOKIN FITTING</p><h1 id="""">AN</h1><p id="""">AN stands for Army-Navy. It was developed as a thread pitch by the US military as a means to standardize the hoses and mating surfaces on machines that both the Army and Navy were using around the time of WWII. JIC has since replaced these fittings in most applications. It actually IS the same fittings, except JIC is not manufactured to the same exacting tolerances as AN fittings are. </p><p id="""">Think of AN as the straight laced Step dad and JIC as that saucy aunt who lets you smoke a cigarette with her. The most common time you will see hydraulic AN fittings is when they are aluminum, anodized (usually red, blue, or black) and in a reusable style in the high performance auto racing industry. It’s called visual horsepower. Didn’t you learn anything from Fast and the Furious? Sheesh.<br>‍<br>You will hear AN called – CONE SEAT, FLARE, RACING FLARE</p><h1 id="""">SAE</h1><p id="""">SAE stands for Society of Automotive Engineers, and this organization basically wrote the book (literally) on what is standard in Hydraulics. With exception, it’s essentially the reference and generally accepted guide to specs and tolerances. </p><p id="""">I might lose you here, so pay attention- SAE has a flare fitting which is 45 degree cone seat, where the sealing action happens metal to metal on the cone as its tightened, just like JIC. You will typically see 45 degree flared fittings in brass applications and usually its air that is being conveyed as opposed to hydraulic, but not always. </p><p id="""">SAE also has a straight thread fitting with an O-Ring, referred to as an O-ring Boss. The sealing action happens between the O-ring and a bevel, or chamfer on the female threads. YES – you can thread a JIC into an SAE. However, this will cause leaks and premature wear at the least. Furthermore, you can thread a JIC into an SAE 45 with the exception of 3/8 and ¾. And before you brain turns to hydraulic fluid, let’s move on.<br>‍<br>You will hear SAE called – BOSS, O-Ring, STRAIGHT THREAD<br>‍<br>You will hear SAE 45 called – Flare, BIG 6 (Big 6 because the 3/8 or -06 is “bigger” than the 3/8 JIC)</p><h1 id="""">NPT</h1><p id="""">National Pipe Thread. There it is. I can see the threads in my mind as an eagle holding an American flag and an AR-15 soars in the horizon. This is probably the most common thread here in God’s country along with JIC. Some call out this abbreviation as National Pipe Taper, which is true in name as all NPT thread is tapered.<br>‍<br>You will hear NPT called – PIPE, MNPT (male), FNPT (female), STANDARD (it’s not, nothing is)</p><h1 id="""">BSPP &amp; BSPT</h1><p id="""">BSPP stands for British Standard Pipe Parallel, and BSPT stands for British Standard Pipe Tapered. BSPP threads are common in Australia and other places where those darn redcoats once had dominion.<br>Which is basically everywhere, but it’s more concentrated in the old commonwealth countries. This one gets confusing to some because the thread callout is based off a nominal size. For the sake of this post,<br>know that they are very similar to NPT but not close enough, and BSPP and BSPT are not interchangeable, though they have the same thread pitch.<br>‍<br>You will hear BSP fittings called – BRITISH, JAPANESE (seriously), BP, G, Rp, R, Rc</p><h4 id="""">JIS</h4><p id="""">JIS stands for Japanese Industrial Standard and this is where things get complicated in the hydraulic world. As if we didn’t have enough to sort out, JIS fittings have a 30 degree cone seat with threads identical to a BSPT.<br>‍<br>You will hear JIS called – “It’s like a weird import thread or something”<br>‍<br>We could carry on, but the point of this is to explain some of the differences between the most common threads you may run across in hydraulics. Honorable mentions include, but are not limited to, Komatsu, Kobelco, Metric DIN, and Face Seal (this one’s actually a good one to cover. More on that later).<br><br>Understand that some of these fittings are very similar dimensionally speaking, and it can be difficult to identify what you are looking at. The safest bet is to bring your hose or fitting in question to American<br>Hose and Supply. Our trained technicians are happy to break down what it is you have, and what you need to get going again. Hopefully this guide helps distinguish between some of these different types of hydraulic threads.

No matter the project, there will always be a fitting that is right for the job. There is also most certainly the wrong fitting for the job. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">Making sure you have the correct hose ends for what you are threading (or flanging) onto is critical. So for this post we are going to be discussing the 3 most popular crimp fittings out there, and their common applications. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">JIC</strong> - For the nerds out there, this stands for Joint Industry Council. This is defined as a fitting with parallel threads, and more importantly it has a 37 degree machined bevel, or ""flare"" seat. JIC fittings do well with hydraulic applications up to 10,000 PSI, as well as fuel delivery. Last year there was a fantastic blog (if we do say so ourselves) written that covers more about this fitting and others, you can find it <a href=""/blogs/the-alphabet-soup-of-hydraulic-hose-fittings-dont-eat-them"">here</a>. Or if you already know all about this because you're a hydraulic smarty pants, you can shop our hydraulic JIC fittings <a href=""/category/fittings"">here</a>. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">NPT</strong> - Good ol' pipe thread. National Pipe Taper, or NPT thread is a fitting that has tapered threads that interlock with their respective female of male counterparts. A great application for this type of thread is gas transfer as well as high pressure fluid conveyance. One note about NPT fittings is that they should never bottom out. They should be installed until the fitting seizes or jams, and will not go any further. PTFE tape can be used for this type of threads, whereas it is not needed for JIC. &nbsp;Do you need a pipe fitting? (I'm not talking about your smoking pipe, ya hippie!) If so, then browse our huge selection of NPT crimp fittings <a href=""/shop/crimp-fittings"">here</a>.</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">SAE / ORB</strong> - O-ring Boss Thread, or also known as SAE thread is used often when hoses are attached to a cylinder or control valve body. SAE threads are straight, and also the exact same as JIC threads (except for -06 and -12 sizes), but the difference is how they seat. SAE straight machine fittings seal with an O-ring at the base of the threads, causing excellent sealing and leak prevention when under high pressure. Most ports on commercial and industrial machinery are SAE threaded, which is why this type of thread makes the list. Like JIC and NPT, O-ring Boss thread fittings can come straight or angled. Our nifty shopping page makes it easy for you to pick the right angle (pun intended) for your application. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">These fittings make up a large part of the hydraulic world, but not all of it! There's all kinds of fittings out there and all types of crimp styles. Bite to wire and compression, as well as field attachable and two piece are all possible options you may encounter.

The following list should help answer your question.</p><ol start="""" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Rubbing / Vibration</strong> - Any time you have a hose that is rubbing against a bracket, bracing, part of the machine, or even another hose, it's a good idea to use spiral wrap or hose sleeve. Pulsation of pressure inside the hose will cause it to move back and forth. Even if this movement is very small, it is not of zero consequence. Over time, this rubbing back and forth will wear through the hose, causing a failure. Using hose protection where rubbing or vibration is involved will greatly extend the life of your hose</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Constant Weather Exposure </strong>- Nature is beautiful, and her weather is awe inspiring. It can also be super inconvenient, annoyingly relentless, and absolutely awful on hydraulic hoses. The sun can cause UV exposure, which will add to the brittleness and hardening of the hoses outer cover. Constant shifting of temperature is also not good for the life of a hose. Using protective hose sleeving that is anti UV is a great additional barrier to have between your hose and that golden flaming ball in the sky. </li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Strain of Tight Routing</strong> - When hoses are routed around lots of corners and bent into tight areas, there are a few problems that could occur. One is that the tight turning around corners could cause the hose to dig into the frame and begin to cut the outer cover of the hose, eventually working its way into the wire braid (not good!). Another issue with straining the hose past the bend radius is that it will prematurely wear down the liner. A bend radius is how many inches of space is needed for the hose to curve 180 degrees. pushing the hose past that measurement will result in premature failure. Using spiral wrap on a hose will prevent the rubbing on the corners and also act as a strain relief for areas where the hose bends.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Traceability and Organization</strong> - Keeping hoses bundled together is a nice way to maintain a degree of organization if the machinery in question has lots of hoses going to multiple areas. As stated earlier, spiral wrap can also come in multiple colors. If a hose runs the length of a long chassis, or perhaps spans a long building, colored protective spiral wrap is a great way to indicate which hose is which when spanning long distances.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Budgetary constraints</strong> - This last one is the golden nugget that is rarely thought of, my friends. The cost of spiral wrap or hose sleeve is usually 25-35% the cost per foot of the hydraulic hose it is covering. True, this can add to a larger cost up front, but in the long run, assuming the hose isn't ripped apart or pinched by the loose nut behind the wheel (aka the guy you hired last week), a larger investment up front can prove to be a wise financial move. Having additional hose protection installed on your product can double the life of your hose (at least!).</li></ol><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">As Willie Shakespeare put it - ""To protect, or not to protect, that is the question."" &nbsp;Well at American Hose and Supply, we think we know this answer ol' Bill is asking for.

If you have a power line down, trucks with booms and buckets will reach high to solve the problem. What's that you say? You need a load of gravel dumped off, and you need a dumpster on site to pick up the gravel!?! Well, that seems like a waste of time and resources, but we don't judge, we simply solute you for using all types of utility bodies on different truck chassis. </p><h2 id="""">What is Truck Upfitting?<br></h2><p id="""">Truck upfitting is the fabrication and installation of different compartments and components on the chassis of a truck, to build a vehicle that can execute a specific service. American Hose and Supply specializes in providing hoses and other components to some of the largest (and most unique!) truck body upfitters in the country. </p><p id="""">Below is a list of components we can supply automotive fabricators and upfitters. <br></p><h3 id="""">1 - Hydraulic Hose</h3><p id="""">What's a good ol' truck body build without hydraulics, right? from final drive hoses, to the hoses that run cranes and rolloffs, hydraulic hoses that are tagged and made to length are critical for assembly and traceability.</p><p id=""""> <br></p><h3 id="""">2 - Air Brake Tubing</h3><p id="""">2- Air Brake Tubing - We are going to go out on a limb here and guess that most service trucks have brakes. Moreover, almost all of them have air actuated brakes as well as air suspension. Air Brake tubing is a critical component for service trucks, and not just on brake components.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Air brake tubing can be used on shifting components, operate gauges, and even be used in those loud horns everyone loves so much. I think the world needs more loud air horns mounted on trucks. If you need more insight into air brake tubing applications and what type to use, click <a href=""/blogs/the-5-dot-parts-replaced-most-on-fleet-trucks"" id="""">here</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""/blogs/the-5-dot-parts-replaced-most-on-fleet-trucks"" id="""">‍</a>‍<br></p><h3 id="""">3 - Black Pipe</h3><p id="""">Schedule 40 and schedule 80 black pipe can be an essential component when plumbing up a service vehicle. Malleable black iron pipe is a fantastic candidate for aiding in the installation of hydraulic reservoirs. This type of material can come in elbows, bushings, and varying lengths of straight pipe. Black pipe or BMI can come in stainless steel material, iron, brass, or be galvanized. You can find all the black pipe you need to plumb up your project <a href=""/shop/black-pipe"" id="""">here</a>.</p><p id="""">‍<br></p><h3 id="""">4 - Hydraulic Adapters</h3><p id="""">Hydraulic adapters are like snowflakes, except they aren't cold, made of water, appear in Hallmark movies, and building an igloo would be costly and heavy. but they ARE all a bit different from one series to another in size, shape, and thread. Connecting hoses to manifolds, valves to tanks, and basically making all the fluid conveyance happen as it should all take adapters. </p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Think of it this way, adapters adapt one thread to another. So fear not, my young upfitter. If your cartridge valve had a 3/8 sae female port, but your hose you are using is JIC, well what we can offer you at American Hose and Supply will connect those two components and make them go together like raccoons and trash day. </p><p id="""">‍<br></p><h3 id="""">5 - Air Hose</h3><p id="""">In many cases, trucks will have tools or hose reels that utilize and carry air. Air hose reels, as well as bulk hose to connect compressor pumps to tanks are all available through American Hose and Supply. 3/8"" and 1/2"" air hose are common sizes for reels that are mounted on many types of service vehicles, while 3/4"" and 1"" are often used for supplying the tank or reservoir. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">This list is just a handful of items commonly used in automotive upfitting. If you have a specific project or your company is in the market for a new upfitting partner, we can help!

In many instances, when these get full, or need to be managed in some way, there will inevitably be hoses involved. There are a few terms for the type of trucks that handle the vacuuming of waste, being a septic truck, honey wagon, environmental management vehicle, and a few others. Listed below are some common items found waste management vehicles that American Hose and Supply provides to this industry daily:<br></p><p id="""">- <strong id="""">EPDM Hose</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""> &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>EPDM hose is a synthetic rubber and compound hose use in waste management. For all the nerds out there, it stands for &nbsp;Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer. This marvel of laboratory science has properties that make it resistance to heat, ozone, and all around harsh weather exposure for long periods of time. Here's another great thing about EPDM hose - it's lightweight and flexible. This hose can hold a full vacuum, and given all it's characteristics, it's obvious why it is the preferred type of hose for this industry. EPDM hose can be green and black, or blue, or even yellow and red. It is commonly referred to as septic hose, Tiger tail, bumble bee hose, or just EPDM. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">- Poly Ball Valves</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A quick tour around a septic truck and you will find quite a few ball valves. In most instances, these valves are constructed of polypropylene, or commonly known as poly. The reason for this is that generally, when exposed to freezing temperatures, a brass ball valve will freeze and crack, whereas poly made ball valves usually will make it through the freeze without having to be replaced. That's not a guarantee here folks, so don't send us an angry email if you have one that freezes and cracks. Just know it USUALLY will fare better than brass. These types of valves come in a wide variety of styles. Construction of the valve body is usually in either a 4 bolt or 6 bolt set up, and the threaded inlets can be female, male, or a combination of those in either an on / off set up, or a directional, or ""three way"" set up. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">- <strong id="""">Camlocks</strong></p><p id=""""> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here they are again to grace us with their presence. The almighty cam and groove coupling. What can we say about them that we have not already? Well, perhaps not much, but it's a guarantee that on septic trucks and vacuum trucks alike, you will see some camlocks. Typically aluminum will be used, and if you're good at ""I spy"" you will probably see a 4"" to 3"" jump size camlock adapter on there. What's that you say? You need a camlock adapter? well you can check out our huge selection of jumpsize cam locks <a href=""/shop/jump-size-camlocks"" id="""">here</a>. </p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">- Water Hose with a Nozzle</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""> &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>Along with sucking up waste materials, another part of waste management is to wash down and wash out receptacles. Water hoses, which are typically a nitrile lined general service hose, will usually be on a reel or coiled up on the truck. A common pressure rating and size for this hose is 200 to 300 PSI, and will come in 1/2"" or 5/8"". To achieve some pressure on this set up, most hoses will be equipped with a nozzle that contains some type of flow adjustment. These nozzles are usually insulated and have a handle that is squeezed to regulate flow, just like you would have on your garden hose at home. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><br></strong></p><p id="""">American Hose and Supply offers every hose, valve, and elbow that is needed to outfit a waste management vehicle. <a href=""tel:9182340585"" id="""">Call</a> us anytime, we can help you or your company get rollin' in no time!</p><p id="""">‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa805113843e1_Waste%20Management%20Hydraulic%20Hoses.png,Wed Jan 25 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64114d13ef7aa8db1538315d/64114d13ef7aa805113843e1_Waste%20Management%20Hydraulic%20Hoses.png
